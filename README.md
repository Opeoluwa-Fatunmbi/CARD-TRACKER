ATM cards, also known as bank cards or debit cards, are plastic cards with a magnetic strip or chip that is used to make transactions at automated teller machines 
(ATMs) and point-of-sale terminals.

They work by allowing the cardholder to access their bank account and withdraw cash, deposit funds, or check their account balance.

The technology used in ATM cards varies depending on the card issuer and the type of card. The most common technology used in ATM cards is a magnetic strip,
which contains encoded information that can be read by a card reader.
These cards are inserted into the ATM and the encoded information is read to access the account information.

Another technology used in ATM cards is a chip, which contains a microprocessor that stores and processes information. 
These cards are inserted into the ATM and the chip communicates with the ATM's terminal to access the account information. 
Chip-enabled cards provide an added layer of security as they are more difficult to copy or skim.

RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field Communication) technology are also used in some ATM cards. 
RFID cards use radio frequency to communicate with the card reader, while NFC cards use magnetic fields to communicate with the card reader. 
These technologies allow for contactless transactions, where the card does not need to be inserted into the ATM, but just need to be near to the ATM.

In conclusion ATM cards can use a magnetic strip, chip, RFID or NFC technology. The most common is the magnetic strip, 
but the chip technology is gradually becoming more popular due to its added security features.
Contactless technology like RFID and NFC are also being used to make transactions more convenient.
